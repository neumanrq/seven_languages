# How to start with Prolog

### OSX

Our Prolog-implementation-of-choice was [SWI Prolog](http://www.swi-prolog.org/build/macos.html). You can install it easily using
homebrew by

    brew install swi-prolog

After installing `SWI Prolog` you should have an executable available named `swipl`. So just
type `swipl` into your shell to start `SWI Prolog` interpreter.
