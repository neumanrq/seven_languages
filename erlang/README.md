# How to start with Erlang

## How to start a REPL

    $ erl

      Erlang/OTP 21 [erts-10.0.4] [source] [64-bit] [smp:4:4] [ds:4:4:10] [async-threads:1] [hipe] [dtrace]

      Eshell V10.0.4  (abort with ^G)
      1>

#### Ehm. How do I quit? 

Just hit `CTRL+G` and type `q`, then hit enter! `CTRL+G` opens a control
menu, i.e. to orchestrate multiple Erlang shells/jobs. Hit `CTRL+G` and then type
`h` followed by `enter` to inspect a list of possible commands within this helper menu.


#### How to compile a local file

    $ erlc path/to/file.erl

or, given a file `pirates.erl` in your folder:
    
    Eshell V10.0.4  (abort with ^G)
    1> c(pirates)
